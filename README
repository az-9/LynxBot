LynxBot/0.1b README
===================

LynxBot is a bash library to help creating webbot beyond the lynx browser.
It parses and analyse the output of the lynx browser and send him commands.

(NB: you need the lynx browser to use LynxBot)


----- Installation -----

    $ ./configure && make
    # make install      (root right needed)


--------- Use ----------

In a first Terminal launch:
    $ lynxbot.sh [an url]

In a second Terminal, source the bash library and begin to play with its functions :
    $ source /usr/local/lib/lynxbot/init_lynxbot
    $ LB_startlynxbot
    ...

Note1: The bash completion will help you to list functions in this API (they all match "LB_*" pattern).

Note2: Open the bash library /usr/local/lib/lynxbot/init_lynxbot to read the complete description of the functions.
