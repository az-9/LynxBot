LynxBot README
===================

LynxBot is a bash library to help creating webbot beyond the lynx browser.
It parses and analyse the output of the lynx browser and send him commands.

(NB: you need the lynx browser to use LynxBot)


----- Installation -----

    $ ./configure && make
    # make install      (root right needed)


--------- Use ----------

In a first Terminal launch:
    $ lynxbot.sh [an url]

In a second Terminal, source the bash library and begin to play with its functions :
    $ source /usr/local/lib/lynxbot/init_lynxbot
    $ echo "$LB_Help_startlynxbot"
    $ LB_startlynxbot
    ...

IMPORTANT:
  To properly works, the 2 terminals should run in the same working directory.
  (removing such condition is a TODO)

Notes:

 * The bash completion will help you to list functions and help messages in this API:
   All function match "LB_*" pattern, while all help messages are in variable matching
   "LB_Help_*" pattern.

 * If you don't care about lynx output and want to run all in one script, you may use
   setsid. Example:
    $ setsid lynxbot.sh -useragent "My Mozilla, etc..." "http://example.com" </dev/null >&0 2>&0 &

 * The behaviour may depend on LINES and COLUMNS and change with such variables (which are unset when redirecting lynxbot.sh to /dev/null). A common mistake is to assume that first link is always selected after an LB_go_link, which is not always the case. To prevent this, always use LB_go_firstl to select the first link.
